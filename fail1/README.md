# A first attempt at discrete transistor amplifier

This did not work for me at all.

I could not get the output to be biased so the idle voltage was 0 volts.

The input differential stage did not seem to work well for me.

I think there is something about needing to balance transistors, use the correct values of resistances for the transistors I have. But also not knowing how to calculate what those are at this time.

Tried building the circuuit in pieces, just the output, just the input side. Then both together. The feedback is important, and here the feedback takes away most of the actual gain.  But still everything kept getting all hot and I burnt up the output transistors.

I learned a bit about the compound pair transistor configuration. ANd that the differential input needs a constant current source. But then also this schematic looks nothing like other examples I keep seeing.
